# HuskyLinks
Meet without Limits!

## Goals of the Project


- To develop a centralized platform that enables University of Washington students to quickly host, find and share activities occurring on and around campus.

- To assist students in returning to live events after becoming acclimated to virtual ones

- To improve user experience by offering people customized event recommendations based on their interests and historical attendance history.

- To make it simple for organizers to plan events and handle event specifics like date, time, and participant data.


 The main goal of the HuskyLinks project is to enhance the UW student experience by providing users with a comprehensive, user-friendly, and engaging platform and by assisting them in returning to live engagements.
 
  # Desired user experience
  
 -  User-Friendly Interface: Our platform should have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows users to quickly find and navigate to the events they're interested in attending.
 
 -  Efficient Event Discovery: Our app should have a comprehensive and up-to-date database of events, with features that make it easy for users to discover events that match their interests, such as filters, search functionality, and sorting options.
 
- Real-Time Updates: To guarantee that users are always up to date and don't miss out on any vital details, our platform should deliver real-time updates concerning occurrences, such as changes in date, time, or location.

- Simple Event Creation: Our platform should feature an easy-to-use interface that allows event organizers to easily create, publish, and update events.

 
 # Implementation details
 
 For the HuskyLinks application's front-end development, we used React with TypeScript. For the back-end development, we used Firebase as our database.
The combination of React with TypeScript and Firebase as our database will allow us to build a scalable, secure, and efficient platform. The platform will have a modern and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, and will provide a seamless event discovery and registration experience for users. Organizers will be able to easily create and manage events, and attendees will be able to browse events near their location, filter events based on their interests and age, and register for events with ease.


## Future


- To assist organizers in creating event descriptions by suggesting relevant details using AI during the event creation process.
- Adding more social elements: The platform might be improved with more social features, such messaging, chat, and group creation, in order to promote a sense of community and collaboration on a deeper level.
- Enhancing user feedback systems: More effective feedback mechanisms could be created to gather comments and suggestions for improvement in order to make sure the platform is meeting the needs and expectations of users.
