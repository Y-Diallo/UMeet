# HuskyLinks
 Discover and Connect with Campus Happenings!"

## Goals of the Project


- To develop a centralized platform that enables University of Washington students to quickly host, find and share activities occurring on and around campus.

- To assist students in returning to live events after becoming acclimated to virtual ones

- To improve user experience by offering people customized event recommendations based on their interests and historical attendance history.

- To make it simple for organizers to plan events and handle event specifics like date, time, and participant data.


 The main goal of the HuskyLinks project is to enhance the UW student experience by providing users with a comprehensive, user-friendly, and engaging platform and by assisting them in returning to live engagements.
 
 # Implementation details
 
 For the HuskyLinks application's front-end development, we used React with TypeScript. For the back-end development, we used Firebase as our database.
The combination of React with TypeScript and Firebase as our database will allow us to build a scalable, secure, and efficient platform. The platform will have a modern and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, and will provide a seamless event discovery and registration experience for users. Organizers will be able to easily create and manage events, and attendees will be able to browse events near their location, filter events based on their interests and age, and register for events with ease.


## Future


- To assist organizers in creating event descriptions by suggesting relevant details using AI during the registration process.
- Adding more social elements: The platform might be improved with more social features, such messaging, chat, and group creation, in order to promote a sense of community and collaboration on a deeper level.
- Enhancing user feedback systems: More effective feedback mechanisms could be created to gather comments and suggestions for improvement in order to make sure the platform is meeting the needs and expectations of users.
